# We need Web API number ordering solution. This solution should have 2 endpoints:

1. We can pass line of numbers from 1 - 10 (few can be skipped) and these numbers should be ordered and saved to file (for ex. result.txt). For ex. we pass 5 2 8 10 1, this file should be saved with following content 1 2 5 8 10
2. We should be able to load content of latest saved file

## Requirements:

1. .Net Core project
2. Business service(s) with unit tests
3. Sorting algorithm should be written yourself for ex. bubble sort (it would be nice if this algorithm would be able to handle any size of numbers not only 1 to 10, .NET definitions might be the limit here)
4. Put source code in GIT.
5. Use dependency injection

### Bonus points:

1. Multiple sorting algorithms are used and time performance is measured between them.
